Purpose: This application translates English to Morse Code or Morse Code to English.
Description: The MORSE CODE TRANSLATOR’s purpose to translate English to Morse Code or Morse Code to English. In the video of the application running, 

Technical/Coding Challenges: I created this application with the intention of practicing using complex programming data structures. A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data, this application uses a map. The map data structure is used for fast look ups or searching data. It stores data in the form of key and value pairs, because morse code has a direct correlation with a letter or number, this key to value relationship was perfect for a morse code translator. I have limited experience with maps so I had to do independent researching and testing of maps to figure out what I had to do. 

Improvements: In the future the program would be more user friendly, with a graphical user interface. I would also add the sounds to the translation system. The user would input a word/phrase and the system would play the morse code beeping back to them; the user could also speak words or tap morse code into a microphone and the program would output the translation.  Unfortunately, sounds/speaking is very complex and would require extensive research.
